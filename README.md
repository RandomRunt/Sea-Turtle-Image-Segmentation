# Sea Turtle Image Segmentation
This project entails a comparison of image segmentation models for the purpose of detecting sea turtles and segmenting sea turtle anatomy. The comparison was between the following image segmentation models: Fully Convolutional Network (FCN), Deeplabv3+, PP-LiteSeg, Mask R-CNN, and U-Net. Here is the <a href="https://readme.com/" target="_blank">link</a> to the formal report for this project.
